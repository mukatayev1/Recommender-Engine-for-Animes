# Recommender-Engine-for-Animes: Project overview
data science project: creating Recommender System from scratch

* Created a recommender engine for animes for two cases:
  1) an item-item recommender using k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and cosine similarity
  2) a top N recommender using matrix factorization
  
* Made a data analysis in order to understand how to use it for creating a recommender system

* Engineered two types of recommender systems: Content based recommender and Collaborative filtering recommender

* Utilized machine learning techniques

# Result

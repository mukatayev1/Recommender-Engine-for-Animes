# Recommender-Engine-for-Animes: Project overview
data science project: creating Recommender System from scratch

* Created a recommender engine for animes for two cases:
  1) User gets recommendations based on what he/she typed i.e. what he/she wants to watch.
  2) User gets recommendations based on what he/she just watched (like Netflix).
  
* Made a data analysis in order to understand how to use it for creating a recommender system
